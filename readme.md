# Zfronk - Flavor, Tech & Hustle

This project is a simple HTML page I created as part of my Power Learn Project (PLP) assignment. It's mainly for practicing HTML structure and indexing, stuff like using semantic tags, internal linking, and meta info that helps with visibility.

"Zfronk" is a personal alias I use to blend my love for tech with my passion for street food. This page is built to show how even a small static file can carry meaning and personality.

## What's inside

* A homepage with structured sections: intro, menu, and story
* Proper use of HTML5 semantic tags
* Internal anchor links using IDs for quick navigation
* Meta tags for visibility and indexing

## Why I built it

I was exploring how simple HTML can still be effective when done right. It's a quick way to sharpen basic skills while making something relatable.

## How to view it

1. Download or clone the project
2. Open the HTML file in your browser
3. Browse through the sections and check the source code if you're curious
