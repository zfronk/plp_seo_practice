# Zfronk - Flavor, Tech & Hustle

This is a basic HTML project that tells the story of "Zfronk" a fictional (but inspired) character based on a self-taught IT guy who transitions into a street food entrepreneur in Kasarani, Kenya. 

It’s part of my ongoing Power Learn Project (PLP) assignments to practice:

- Proper HTML5 structure
- Semantic tags for accessibility and SEO
- Indexing sections with IDs and navigation links
- Clean, readable layout that improves visibility

## 📌 Project Features

- **Header & Navigation:** Includes a responsive title, short description, and navigation links to internal sections.
- **Main Sections:**
  - `Introduction`: Background on Zfronk.
  - `Menu`: Details of what's served at the fast food joint.
  - `His Story`: Personal journey from code to cuisine.
- **Meta Tags for SEO:** Description meta tag to improve indexing.
- **Footer:** Built-in copyright.

## 💡 Purpose

This page is a creative mix of HTML practice and personal branding exercise. It reflects how HTML can be used not only to build structure but also to tell stories that add visibility online.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 (no CSS or JS yet – raw structure only)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser
